Here is my submission for the technical test

I did as much as I could in the time given and tried to go as far above and beyond in the time I had allocated. It is unfinished and there is a lot that I would still like to do but I am confident that this a good representation of my abilities and work ethic.

I appreciate any time taken to look through this and appreciate any feedback available.
