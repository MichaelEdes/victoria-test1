To Get Started on the Project

1. In the terminal, enter 'npm i' or 'npm install' to install dependencies.

2. Once completed, enter npm run start to start the development server.

3. The server should start on localhost:3000. You can view the site by visiting http://localhost:3000.

What Went Well

I dedicated significant time to understanding the data structures returned from the server and identifying which data parts correspond to specific UI elements and key variables essential for filtering. I believe I was particularly thorough in mapping and displaying product data, ensuring that key UI elements reflected the server's flags accurately. This attention to detail helped establish a solid foundation for the remaining tasks.

Areas for Improvement

One area I'd like to improve is the filtering process. While I made progress in understanding the subtractive filtering process, itâ€™s not yet fully aligned with my vision. Given more time, I would work to enhance the cohesiveness between user input and visual response, a critical factor in UI and UX development. This would create a more seamless and responsive user experience.
